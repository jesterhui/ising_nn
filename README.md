## About

We implement the Metropolis-Hastings and Wolff Monte Carlo algorithms for solving the Ising model, and then use restricted Boltzmann machines and deep belief networks to probe the ability of deep networks to represent a physical probability distribution. Based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04622).
